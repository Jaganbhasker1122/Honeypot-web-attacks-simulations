# Honeypot Web Simulation

A comprehensive web-based honeypot simulation to demonstrate various cybersecurity attack scenarios and educate users about security vulnerabilities. The project includes multiple attack demonstrations with detailed explanations to raise awareness about potential risks and countermeasures.

## Features

### Simulated Attacks:
- **SQL Injection**: Demonstrates how malicious SQL queries can compromise databases.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Explains how attackers can inject malicious scripts into web pages.
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Simulates flooding a server with excessive requests.
- **Keylogger Simulation**: Showcases how keystrokes can be captured.
- **Adware**: Displays simulated malicious ads to mimic real-world adware behavior.
- **Malicious File Downloading**: Warns users about downloading potentially harmful files.

### Other Features:
- **Interactive UI**: User-friendly design with detailed information cards for each attack.
- **Learning Focus**: Explains how each attack works and its real-world implications.
- **Home Navigation**: A central hub to explore different attack simulations.
- **Secure Practices**: Highlights mitigation techniques and best practices for each attack.
